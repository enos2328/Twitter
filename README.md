### Notes
My challenge was having TwitterAPICaller give me a lovely **BDBOAuth1Manager** error all of a sudden after working perfectly fine for the entire time. I googled every way to fix it and nothing changed. It wouldn't even let me build anything to be able to show the app that I had done so far. I had just finished implementing the favorite/unfavorite code in the TweetTableViewController.swift file. Fantastic.
